### GIT Hook: commit-msg

Verify source code fulfills coding standards as described in .estlintrc file.

In order to use this hook you want to copy ```commit-msg``` file to your repository's hook directory.

By doing so it will register a hook that automatically run verifications to staged files every time you want to commit them.

If verification ends without error the commit will go thru normally. Otherwise it will abort until the code is modified to pass the verification.

#### 1. GET STARTED

Code styling verification hook is built atop of ESLint and other additional plugins which all of them
are available to install via npm/yarn package manager.

```
git commit app/scripts/app.js -m "fo"

# Running commit-msg git hook
# ------------------------------------------------------
# Location:      /Users/jaziel.lopez/WebstormProjects/aig-pcp-frontend
# Branch:        development
# Last revision: e2179815833a1ab4d77e66a5bdb52acd380072ae

...please stand by eslint had started to verify staged changes...
